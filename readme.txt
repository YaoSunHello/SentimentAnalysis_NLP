This file contains two model. 
Start from train_test_split.py, this file is used to split train dataset 
and validation dataset. You can randomly select a subset dataset from train.csv
for the use of a fast look of the model. To train on the entire dataset will cause you 
more than several hours.

To directly perform the model, just use run_train.py file.
there are several library need to be downloaded.

Finally, The Linear Model and LSTM Model is based on pytorch library.
!pip install torch
